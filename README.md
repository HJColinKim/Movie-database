Users can search up a variety of different films and TV shows and they will see a database of posters

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: Utilizing more features of API. Users at the moment can only see posters of the films, just like a database. Looking into adding proper redirection for users to the film's 
wikipedia page or some other redirection so users can look into the film further than just the posters.
